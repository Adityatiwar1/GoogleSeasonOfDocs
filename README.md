The National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) has participated in Google Summer of Code for over a decade. The Season of Docs is a complementary program focused on all levels of documentation for our open source projects. See [Project Ideas](https://github.com/nrnb/GoogleSeasonOfDocs/issues) for specific proposals of what we'd like to work on together with professional technical writers.
